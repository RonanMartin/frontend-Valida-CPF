# Valida CPF Frontend

This page connects with the Valida CPF Backend. It is a simulation of a microservice client, developed for study purposes.

## **Why did I?**

To better understand how the backend communicates with the frontend, it is necessary to understand a little about the frontend. So a little bit of HTML, CSS and JS opened my mind about it.

## **What does it do?**

This frontend page has a search field that sends a CPF on port 8080. On this port we previously run the "Valida CPF Backend", which will check whether our CPF is correct and respond with a message in JSON.
Then our Valida CPF Frontend will show us the answer with a green letter if it is correct or red if it is not, and in the same way it will also change the color of the search field.
